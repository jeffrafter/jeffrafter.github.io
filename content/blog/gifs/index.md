"It's really hard to make Gifs." [^dws]

At the end of 2017 at GitHub we were workng on a secret research project: can you completely eliminate
the friction new developers face. Removing the development environment and the terminal was a start–understanding
how to use Git alone is a major barrier for new developers–but it is only a start. Our project,
called "Tiny" internally, had of vision of development that was so effortless people would find
themselves "accidentally" coding. But first we needed a challenging problem where coding might be
the simplest solution. Animated Gifs were our problem.

[^dws]:

  I was staying in a rented house west of Phoenix. It was summer and I was pacing outside
  in the 117º heat talking to Daniel Warner Smith about what the experience should be. "It's really
  hard to make Gifs," he said. He was right; other than animating them frame by frame there aren't
  many tools. It was a good user problem and coding might be the simplest answer. As we talked,
  my iPhone overheated twice.
