Everything you know about berries is probably wrong. Unless you know a lot about berries; then you know why it needs to be discussed. It turns out that what the botanists think about berries and what your mom told you have almost nothing in common.

## Berries & Lightning Talks

At an internal GitHub summit in Boston in January 2018[^boston], there
was an opporunity to give lightning talks. I was told I needed to give one about twenty minutes before they were meant to begin. Corey Hobbs, Nick Hengeveld, Mike Coutermarsh and I had eaten lunch just before and the subject of berries came up. We had even searched the web for examples (credit @nickh with finding several of these). I thought it would make a good talk and put it together as quickly as possible.

  If you're wondering who would plan a meeting in Boston in January I can tell you: Kyle Daigle.
