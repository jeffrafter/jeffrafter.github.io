Previously, I posted about <a href="/working-with-github-actions">Working with GitHub Actions</a>. It covered the basics of setting up a repository, configuring embedded actions and the associated workflows. If you haven't worked with GitHub Actions before, you might want to read that first.

Once you've created your amazing GitHub Actions, you'll want to re-use them and share them with your friends. To do that you'll want to organize your project a little differently. Also, you'll want to release your actions with all of the dependencies included so that they run efficiently. In this post we'll create a repository which contains a GitHub Action - built in TypeScript - and a second repository which will use the action.

Before you read this it is important to note: starting with a [template](https://github.com/jeffrafter/typescript-action-template) will save you a lot of time and setup. Creating actions can be very simple. In this post, however, I am going to work through and explain all of the steps. Included in this post are some of the reasons I've chosen one particular setup and skipped another. When getting started with GitHub Actions it is difficult to understand how all of the pieces fit together, or why you might want to create an action for a particular task. Hopefully this post provides some helpful examples. That said, there are probably steps here that you've seen before, don't care about, or just want to skip and that's okay.

In order to follow this, you'll need a GitHub account. You'll need Node, Node Version Manager (`nvm`), and Node Package Manager (`npm`). The examples will be in TypeScript. All of the code is available at https://github.com/jeffrafter/honk-action.

# Honk

For our example we'll create a GitHub Action which listens for new issue comments - if the comment doesn't contain the word "honk" our action will delete the comment and add a new comment with a picture of the goose from [Untitled Goose Game](https://goose.game/).[^goose] This isn't very practical, but it should serve as a good foundation for building actions that respond to comments.

[^goose]: The inspiration for this GitHub Action came from a Discord Bot created by [@melissamcewen](https://twitter.com/melissamcewen/status/1176980019811405824).

Here is the layout for our action:

```
__tests__
  honk.test.ts
.eslintignore
.eslintrc.json
.gitignore
.nvmrc
action.yml
honk.ts
jest.config.js
package-lock.json
package.json
README.md
tsconfig.json
```

Notice that `honk.ts` and `__tests__` are both in the root of our repository. In this case our action is not very complex, using only a single file. If you have a complex action which contains many modules it might make sense to to put these into a `src` or `lib` folder.

We'll dig into each of these files.

# Setup

First you want to create a folder for your project:

```bash
mkdir honk-action
cd honk-action
```

## Environment

As we did in the previous post we'll be using TypeScript to build our action, which requires Node. Out of the box GitHub supports a few environments for your actions to run [^environments]. There is built-in support for running actions built in JavaScript (using Node). When we release our action we'll package up the compiled JavaScript so that users of the action don't need to install the TypeScript dependencies. Taking a few extra seconds to build your action on execution may not seem like a big deal; but GitHub Actions have a limited about of [free](https://github.com/features/actions) compute time. While developing an action this might not matter; but long-term those seconds can add up. Leveraging the default environments means your action will run more quickly and reduce the amount of billable hours used.

[^environments]: There are several different [virtual operating systems](https://help.github.com/en/articles/virtual-environments-for-github-actions#supported-virtual-environments-and-hardware-resources) you can use for your actions which come preloaded with [useful software](https://help.github.com/en/articles/software-in-virtual-environments-for-github-actions). Additionally, you can utilize Docker containers running in one of these virtual environments to pre-configure your hosts.

Let's setup our example to use Node. If you have multiple local projects you might run into a conflict about which Node version should be used. [Node Version Manager](https://npm.github.io/installation-setup-docs/installing/using-a-node-version-manager.html) solves this problem. After installing a Node Version Manager, check which version of Node you have installed:

```
nvm ls
```

If you don't have the version you want, find a remote version:

```
nvm ls-remote
```

This will show lots of versions. Find the last one with `LTS` (for Long Term Support). Generally LTS versions are very stable. Install it using:

```
nvm install 12.16.1
```

To control which version of Node should be used in your project, add a `.nvmrc`[^dotfiles] file:

```json
12.16.1
```

The file is pretty simple; just the version. I chose 12.16.1 because it matches the version that is used to run our action (`node12`). Node 10.16.3 is installed in the default [GitHub Action software environment](https://help.github.com/en/articles/software-in-virtual-environments-for-github-actions) and can be used as well but will not match the running action environment. At the time you read this there may be a newer version of Node or you may chose to use an older version because your code requires it. You can check https://nodejs.org.

[^dotfiles]: Notice that the `.nvmrc` file starts with a "`.`" (period). By default on most systems this creates a hidden file. Oftentimes general project config is hidden away. On MacOS you can show hidden files in Finder by running `defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool true` and restarting Finder. If you want to list hidden files in your console use the `-a` parameter: `ls -a`.

## Ignore some things

We plan to use `git` to keep track of our changes. As we work on our project locally, there will be a lot of files we won't want to keep track of; we'll want to ignore them. To do this we'll create a `.gitignore` file. If you are looking for an complete example `.gitignore` you can check out https://github.com/github/gitignore. For now, just copy the following (this `.gitignore` includes only what is important for this post. For a more complete version see [here](https://github.com/jeffrafter/honk-action/blob/master/.gitignore)):

```.gitignore
# Dependency directories
node_modules/

# Logs
logs
*.log
npm-debug.log*

# Typescript v1 declaration files
typings/

# Optional npm cache directory
.npm

# Optional eslint cache
.eslintcache
```

With this setup we'll ignore `node_modules`. Again, when we release our action we'll need the dependencies included. If we don't include them, we'll need users of our action to install them which will not only take 25 to 30 seconds but will require extra steps in the calling workflow.

## Packages & Dependencies

For almost any Node project you'll find that you use a lot of packages â€“ you'll have far more code in packages in your `node_modules` folder (where package code is stored) than your main project.

Initialize your packages:

```bash
npm init -y
```

Now you have a `package.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "honk-action",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Let's simplify it a bit (you can fill out or keep fields you like here, but this is the minimum):

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "test": "tsc --noEmit && jest"
  },
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

The only scripts we need at the moment are `build` which will convert our TypeScript to JavaScript and `test` which will run our tests. While we're developing our action we'll need access to all of our project's dependencies; but when we release our action we don't want to include the testing, linting and TypeScript dependencies. Because of this, the difference between `dependencies` and `devDependencies` is important (as well as `--save` versus `--save-dev`).

```bash
npm install --save \
  @actions/core \
  @actions/github
```

The `@actions/core` and `@actions/github` are the baseline for interacting with GitHub and the incoming events. Our published action will need these dependencies when it runs.

When developing we'll want to add testing support to test our action:

```bash
npm install --save-dev \
  jest \
  nock
```

## TypeScript

Let's add TypeScript support to our development dependencies:

```bash
npm install --save-dev \
  typescript \
  ts-jest
```

Finally, because we're using TypeScript, we'll want to add type support for development:

```bash
npm install --save-dev \
  @types/jest \
  @types/node
```

We'll need to configure TypeScript before we can build our action. Create `tsconfig.json`:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "module": "commonjs",
    "target": "esnext",
    "lib": ["es2015", "es2017"],
    "strict": true,
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "noUnusedLocals": true,
    "noUnusedParameters": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "removeComments": false,
    "preserveConstEnums": true
  },
  "include": ["**/*.ts"],
  "exclude": ["node_modules"]
}
```

By default this allows us to build all of the actions contained in our repository, adds some strict compile-time checks, and skips type checking for our dependencies.

## Keep it clean (optional)

> Note: this section is not required to complete this tutorial; if you want to skip it feel free.

Everyone has different preferences when they edit code. Some prefer tabs over spaces. Some want two spaces instead of four. Some prefer semicolons and some don't. It shouldn't matter right? But it does. If editors are auto-formatting code based on user preferences it is important to make sure everyone has chosen the same set of defaults for that auto-formatting. This makes it easy to tell what changed between versions â€“ even when different developers (with different preferences) have made changes.

For this reason we'll setup a linter and code formatter for our code. Install [eslint](https://eslint.org/) and [prettier](https://prettier.io/):

```bash
npm install --save-dev \
  eslint \
  @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin \
  @typescript-eslint/parser \
  eslint-config-prettier \
  eslint-plugin-prettier \
  prettier
```

Now that we have the packages we'll need to configure them in `.eslintrc.json`:

```json
{
  "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
  "plugins": ["@typescript-eslint", "prettier"],
  "extends": [
    "eslint:recommended",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "prettier/@typescript-eslint",
    "plugin:prettier/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "prettier/prettier": [
      "error",
      {
        "singleQuote": true,
        "trailingComma": "all",
        "bracketSpacing": false,
        "printWidth": 120,
        "tabWidth": 2,
        "semi": false
      }
    ],
    // octokit/rest requires parameters that are not in camelcase
    "camelcase": "off",
    "@typescript-eslint/camelcase": ["error", {"properties": "never"}]
  },
  "env": {
    "node": true,
    "jest": true,
    "es6": true
  },
  "parserOptions": {
    "ecmaVersion": 2018,
    "sourceType": "module"
  }
}
```

I won't go into too much detail here; there are [better explanations](https://www.robertcooper.me/using-eslint-and-prettier-in-a-typescript-project) to be found. This configuration does a few things:

- Relies on the typescript eslint parser with the prettier plugin - I've found this works very well in @Code. If you were previously using `ts-lint` with prettier this setup should replace your old configuration.
- This eslint config doesn't work perfectly for projects that contain both JavaScript and TypeScript - because of that we won't attempt to lint JavaScript files in our project
- I've turned off the camelcase rules for properties - when writing GitHub Actions you will likely use properties from `@actions/github` and from the API and these will not be camelcase.[^camelcase]
- The expected environment should include `node` and `jest` - this will help `eslint` ignore missing declarations for things like `describe`, `process`, `module`, etc.

[^camelcase]: There are lots of ways to name variables including `camelCase`, `snake_case`, `ProperCase`, and `CONSTANT_CASE`. JavaScript and TypeScript tend to use `camelCase` for variable names, but Ruby (which is what much of GitHub and the GitHub API is written in) generally uses `snake_case`. This is one of those places where the idioms of different languages collide and you have to make the best of it.

If you need to ignore specific files when linting you can add them to `.eslintignore`. Because our setup doesn't work well for JavaScript we'll ignore all JavaScript files in `.eslintignore`:

```
*.js
```

Add a `lint` item to the `scripts` node in `package.json`:

```
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    "test": "tsc --noEmit && jest",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts"
  },
```

With this in place we can run:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Wait, there's an error:

```
Oops! Something went wrong! :(

ESLint: 6.6.0.

No files matching the pattern "." were found.
Please check for typing mistakes in the pattern.
```

We haven't written any TypeScript to lint yet. Time to stop configuring and start writing code.

# Building the action

Create a new file called `honk.ts`:

```ts
import * as core from '@actions/core'
import * as github from '@actions/github'

const run = async (): Promise<void> => {
  try {
    // Our action will need to API access the repository so we require a token
    // This can be set in the calling workflow or it can use the default
    const token = process.env['GITHUB_TOKEN'] || core.getInput('token')
    if (!token || token === '') return

    // Create the octokit client
    const octokit: github.GitHub = new github.GitHub(token)

    // The environment contains a variable for current repository. The repository
    // will be formatted as a name with owner (`nwo`); e.g., jeffrafter/example
    // We'll split this into two separate variables for later use
    const nwo = process.env['GITHUB_REPOSITORY'] || '/'
    const [owner, repo] = nwo.split('/')

    // This action works on issue comments. Because of this we expect the context
    // payload to contain the issue and the comment
    const issue = github.context.payload['issue']
    if (!issue) return
    const comment = github.context.payload.comment
    const commentBody = comment.body

    // If the comment contains "honk" anywhere in the body, there is nothing for our action to do
    if (commentBody.match(/honk/i)) return

    // The comment didn't contain "honk", delete it
    // https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/#octokit-routes-issues-delete-comment
    const deleteCommentResponse = await octokit.issues.deleteComment({
      owner,
      repo,
      comment_id: comment.id,
    })
    console.log(`Deleted comment! ${JSON.stringify(deleteCommentResponse.status)}`)

    // Add a new comment that says honk
    // https://octokit.github.io/rest.js/#octokit-routes-issues-create-comment
    const issueCommentResponse = await octokit.issues.createComment({
      owner,
      repo,
      issue_number: issue.number,
      body:
        '![honk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4064/65900857-cf462f80-e36b-11e9-9a9c-76170c99618b.png)',
    })
    console.log(`Honk! ${issueCommentResponse.data.url}`)
  } catch (error) {
    // If there is any error we'll fail the action with the error message
    console.error(error.message)
    core.setFailed(`Honk-action failure: ${error}`)
  }
}

// Don't auto-execute in the test environment
if (process.env['NODE_ENV'] !== 'test') {
  run()
}

export default run
```

The code inside your action should be auto-executing. In this case we define a `run`[^run] method and then immediately call it right after it has been defined. In fact, you don't even need to define a method, you could include the code for your action directly. In some cases that might be okay, but as the complexity of the action increases it would become confusing. We've also made our function the default export. This isn't required but will make things easier as we move forward and test our code.

The image this includes is:

![honk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4064/65900857-cf462f80-e36b-11e9-9a9c-76170c99618b.png)

[^run]: We've named our function `run` but you could name the function anything you wanted. `run` is a convention used in the base [`typescript-template`](https://github.com/actions/typescript-action/blob/master/src/main.ts)

## Testing the action

Create a new file called `__tests__/honk.test.ts`:

```ts
import * as github from '@actions/github'
import * as core from '@actions/core'
import {WebhookPayload} from '@actions/github/lib/interfaces'
import nock from 'nock'
import run from '../honk'

beforeEach(() => {
  // resetModules allows you to safely change the environment and mock imports
  // separately in each of your tests
  jest.resetModules()
  jest.spyOn(core, 'getInput').mockImplementation((name: string): string => {
    if (name === 'token') return '12345'
    return ''
  })

  process.env['GITHUB_REPOSITORY'] = 'example/repository'

  // Create a mock payload for our tests to use
  // https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#issuecommentevent
  github.context.payload = {
    action: 'created',
    issue: {
      number: 1,
    },
    comment: {
      id: 1,
      user: {
        login: 'monalisa',
      },
      body: 'Honk',
    },
  } as WebhookPayload
})

afterEach(() => {
  expect(nock.pendingMocks()).toEqual([])
  nock.isDone()
  nock.cleanAll()
})

describe('honk action', () => {
  // The most basic test is just checking that the run method doesn't throw an error.
  // This test relies on our default payload which contains "honk" in the comment body.
  it('runs', async () => {
    await expect(run()).resolves.not.toThrow()
  })

  it('deletes the comment and adds a comment', async () => {
    // Override the default payload so that it doesn't include "honk". This should make the
    // action run through more of the code
    github.context.payload.comment.body = 'No geese allowed'

    // Use nock to mock out the external call to delete the comment
    // Setting this up creates an expectation that must be called and returns a 200 response
    nock('https://api.github.com')
      .delete('/repos/example/repository/issues/comments/1')
      .reply(200, {})

    // Use nock to mock out the external call to create the honk comment
    // Setting this up creates an expectation that must be called and returns a 200 response
    nock('https://api.github.com')
      .post(`/repos/example/repository/issues/1/comments`, body => {
        return (
          body.body ===
          '![honk](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4064/65900857-cf462f80-e36b-11e9-9a9c-76170c99618b.png)'
        )
      })
      .reply(200, {
        url: 'https://github.com/#example',
      })

    await run()
  })
})
```

We import the actions core library and the run method we just created in our honk action. We only have two tests, a very basic test which guarantees that by default we don't throw errors. The second uses `nock` to mock out any external calls. These expectations must be satisfied or the test will fail (because of the check in the `afterEach` callback). Additionally, if there are any unexpected external calls the test will fail.

In order to run these tests we'll need to configure Jest. Create a new file called `jest.config.js` in the root of your project:

```js
// Setup nock to disable all external calls
const nock = require('nock')
nock.disableNetConnect()

// By default, debug messages are written to the console which can make the test output confusing
// Instead, bind to stdout and hide all debug messages
const processStdoutWrite = process.stdout.write.bind(process.stdout)
process.stdout.write = (str, encoding, cb) => {
  // Debug messages begin with ::
  if (str.match(/^::/)) return false
  return processStdoutWrite(str, encoding, cb)
}

module.exports = {
  clearMocks: true,
  moduleFileExtensions: ['js', 'ts'],
  testEnvironment: 'node',
  testMatch: ['**/*.test.ts'],
  transform: {
    '^.+\\.ts$': 'ts-jest',
  },
  verbose: true,
}
```

At this point you can run the tests. From your terminal run:

```bash
npm test
```

You should see:

```
> @ test ...
> tsc --noEmit && jest

 PASS  __tests__/honk.test.ts
  honk action
    âœ“ runs (10ms)
    âœ“ deletes the comment and adds a comment (32ms)

  console.log honk.ts:37
    Deleted comment! 200

  console.log honk.ts:47
    Honk! https://github.com/#example

Test Suites: 1 passed, 1 total
Tests:       2 passed, 2 total
Snapshots:   0 total
Time:        1.729s
Ran all test suites.
```

We can also run our `lint` task to verify that our code is clean:

```bash
npm run lint
```

It should succeed with no errors and no warnings[^before-each].

[^before-each]: If you get an error or warning about missing `beforeEach`, it is possible you are not using the correct version of Node and npm. In your project directory run `nvm use` and try again.

### Create the action.yml for the honk action

We've written the code for our action and a test that tells us it is working. Unfortunately we haven't defined how our action should be used. To do that we have to configure the action in a `yml` file. In our previous post on Working with GitHub Actions our action was embedded in our project and wasn't meant to be reused. In this case we want the action to be used; create `action.yml` in the project root:

```yaml
name: honk
description: "Checks to see if a comment contains 'Honk', otherwise deletes it"
author: '@jeffrafter'
inputs:
  token:
    description: >
      GitHub token used to create and remove comments. By default, this uses the
      repository token provided by GitHub Actions. You can customize the user by
      replacing this token with a user token which has write-access to your
      repository. Note that the token will be accessible to all repository
      collaborators.
    default: ${{ github.token }}
runs:
  using: 'node12'
  main: './dist/index.js'
```

There are [more configuration options available](https://help.github.com/en/articles/metadata-syntax-for-github-actions) for actions but this represents the minimum amount needed to run. Specifically, it gives the action a name (which does not need to match the name of our TypeScript file) and points to the the code `./dist/index.js`. Unfortunately, we don't yet have a file called `dist/index.js`, we only have a file called `honk.ts`. GitHub Actions have built-in support for JavaScript and cannot run TypeScript directly. Because of this we will need to _transpile_ our TypeScript to JavaScript before it can be run. We'll do this as part of our release step.

We've also included an input for our `token` which defaults to the repository token provided by the GitHub Actions runner. By using an input (instead of an environment variable) we simplify the configuration for workflows that use our action.[^joshmgross] By default the workflow doesn't need to include any value. Individual workflows can be customized by overriding the default and setting an input (generally, by using a token stored in the repository's secrets).

[^joshmgross]: Previously, I would use an environment variable out of habit. [Josh Gross](https://github.com/joshmgross) showed me this trick. Not only can you have default values (as we've done here), but you can add documentation for users that will appear in the workflow editor (when you publish your action in the marketplace).

For more information on creating secrets, see [Creating and using encrypted secrets](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-and-using-encrypted-secrets).

For more information on using secrets and tokens for authentication, see [Authenticating with the github token](https://help.github.com/en/actions/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/authenticating-with-the-github_token).[^security]

[^security]: Be careful when using [personal access tokens](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line) as secrets. Because GitHub Actions have the ability to read your repository secrets, any collaborator could steal your token by modifying the workflow and exfiltrating the secret. If the token you've included in your secrets has a broad set of permissions this can be very dangerous.

# Releasing a GitHub Action

At this point our action is built. If we create the honk-action repository on GitHub and push up the results, however, it won't work. When workflows refer to actions defined in other repositories it expects there to be a release.

GitHub provides documentation on releasing your action:

- https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/creating-a-javascript-action#commit-and-push-your-action-to-github
- https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/publishing-actions-in-github-marketplace

## Creating a workflow that points to the action

In order to use a published action a repository must use a workflow. For example:

```yml
name: Honk workflow
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Honk
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: jeffrafter/honk-action@v1
```

Notice that the action is referenced by the username and action repository along with a version number; in this case `@v1`. This version number refers to a tagged release. This helps ensure that that users of your action have consistent behavior (for example providing the correct inputs and seeing consistent outputs). As an action author you can make use of whatever versioning system you want (including semantic versions) however the actions runner will treat everything after the `@` as a ref[^ref] and expects and exact match.

[^ref]: Workflows can also refer to GitHub Actions by SHA. In many cases this is much safer as an author could make changes to the code for a given tag.

## Preparing the release

To release our action we need to do the following:

1. Verify that our tests pass and there are no lint errors
1. Compile our TypeScript to JavaScript
1. Include our dependencies (but not our development dependencies)
1. Push our release
1. Create a tag for our release

## Compiling a release using Zeit's `ncc`

If your action is utilizing a small set of runtime dependencies which are cross-platform, you can utilize [zeit/ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc) to compile your action to a single file. In most cases this is a much simpler and better workflow then manually preparing your dependencies for release. Additionally, `ncc` works with TypeScript, simplifying things even more.

Install it as a development dependency:

```bash
npm install --save-dev @zeit/ncc
```

> Note: Zeit recommends you install `ncc` globally. I tend to avoid global packages as the interface may change over time and you may have multiple projects using the dependency differently.

With this installed, let's change the `build` script in `package.json`:

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc --noEmit && ncc build honk.ts -o dist -m",
    "test": "tsc --noEmit && jest",
    "lint": "eslint . --ext .ts"
  },
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

The `build` script will do a few things:

1. Compile our TypeScript (without emitting)
1. Use `ncc` to build a version of `honk.ts` which includes all of the dependencies
1. Minify that build and save it to the `dist/` folder

We've also specified that our `main` is `dist/index.js` (the file `ncc` will generate). This isn't required but can help with discovery and automation.

The distribution that `ncc` creates includes only the _necessary_ dependencies. This means the resulting distribution file is incredibly small (when compared to the size of `node_modules`). Even though the file is smaller it is still complex and can be easily auto-generated. Because of this, it doesn't need to be stored in our repository; it will make reviewing future pull-requests more difficult. For this reason you might choose to add it to your `.gitignore`. On the other hand, swapping things in and out of your `.gitignore` can be cumbersome.

My solution is to do nothing: which happens to be the easiest solution. Instead, I _only_ run `build` on release branches.[^mistake]

[^mistake]: What happens if someone accidentally runs `build` on a feature branch or on master? Well as log as they don't mistakenly add the `dist` folder to git, nothing happens. If they do add the `dist` folder to their change you can easily reject the change or remove the folder in a subsequent change. To avoid this you could add a release branch check to the build script before running `ncc`.

Let's create `v1` of our Honk action. Start by creating a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b releases/v1
```

Run all of the checks:

```bash
npm run lint
npm test
```

And build:

```bash
npm run build
```

Checking `git status` you see:

```
On branch releases/v1
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	dist/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Let's add the `dist` folder:

```bash
git add .
```

At this point we can create a commit:

```bash
git commit -m "v1"
```

Let's push the `releases/v1` branch to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin releases/v1
```

Next we'll want to create a tag for our release and push it:

```bash
git tag -fa v1 -m "v1"
git push origin v1
```

Honk action `v1` is now ready to be used by remote workflows.

Utilizing `ncc` to generate your distribution simplifies the process of transpiling, preparing your dependencies for release, and bundling it all together. So why wouldn't you do this all the time? In general you should. Very rarely, it is useful manually prepare a release when your action relies on native dependencies which must be compiled for the target platform (for example, you are developing on Windows or a Mac and you have to compile a dependency for running on Ubuntu). In those cases, creating your distribution requires more explicit control.

## Pushing changes to a release

Understanding how to create and tag new releases is helpful. But sometimes you want to push changes to an existing tagged release. This is convenient because it doesn't require changes to workflows that use your action. However, you should only do this if the change is backward compatible with the existing usage. If, for example, you add a new required input, you'll need to create a new release and have users upgrade.

To change an existing release, you can create a new commit and force-push it, then remove and republish the associated tags. I've included all of the commands here:

```bash
# Checkout the release branch
git checkout releases/v1
# Get this branch even with master so the latest changes are included
git reset --hard master
# Rerun the checks and rebuild the TypeScript and ncc distribution
npm run build
# Add the dist
git add .
# Commit
git commit -m "v1"
# Force push to overwrite any previous commits for this branch
git push -f origin releases/v1
# Remove previously pushed tags (v1 will be unusable momentarily until you re-push)
git push origin :refs/tags/v1
# Re-apply the tag
git tag -fa v1 -m "v1"
# Push everything
git push origin v1
```

These steps are tedious but can be easily automated.

# Using the released action in a workflow

In order to execute the `honk-action` we need to create a workflow. Let's create another repository called `honk-test`.

```
mkdir honk-test
cd honk-test
```

Workflows should be kept in the `.github/workflows` folder in your repository. Your repository may contain multiple workflows. Create `.github/workflows/honk-workflow.yml`:

```yml
name: Honk workflow
on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  build:
    name: Honk
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: jeffrafter/honk-action@v1
```

We've created a workflow that should be executed whenever issue comments are `[created]`. There are many different [events that trigger workflows](https://help.github.com/en/articles/events-that-trigger-workflows). By specifying `[created]` we're saying that every time a new comment is added to an issue in our GitHub repository our workflow should be executed. In this case we've chosen to execute our workflow using the `ubuntu-latest` environment. Our workflow has a single step which uses the `honk-action@v1` we released.[^versioning]

[^versioning]: Versioning can be very difficult. We've started with a very simple numeric strategy here. This is fine for most projects but in larger projects you may want to use Semantic Versioning or rely on the the versioning system built into `npm`. GitHub also has [action versioning recommendations](https://github.com/actions/toolkit/blob/master/docs/action-versioning.md#recommendations).

This should be enough to run our `honk-action`. Commit this and push it to GitHub.

```bash
git status
```

You should see:

```bash
On branch master
Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)

	.github/workflows/

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

Let's add the workflow:

```bash
git add .
```

And commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Honk workflow and configuration"
```

All that's left is to push it to GitHub and try it out. Create a [new repository](https://github.com/new). Again, I called mine `honk-test` and made it public.

![Creating a new repository](../../assets/action-honk-test.png)

Once you've created the repository you'll need to click the `SSH` button make sure to setup the remote for your repository to use `ssh` instead of HTTPs:

![Choose ssh](../../assets/action-http-ssh-honk-test.png)

Unfortunately you can't push workflow changes via HTTPs as it is considered an integration. If you try you'll see something like the following when you try to push:

```bash
Enumerating objects: 31, done.
Counting objects: 100% (31/31), done.
Delta compression using up to 12 threads
Compressing objects: 100% (25/25), done.
Writing objects: 100% (31/31), 55.08 KiB | 7.87 MiB/s, done.
Total 31 (delta 6), reused 0 (delta 0)
remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (6/6), done.
To https://github.com/jeffrafter/honk-test.git
 ! [remote rejected] master -> master (refusing to allow an integration to create or update .github/workflows/debug-workflow.yml)
error: failed to push some refs to 'https://github.com/jeffrafter/honk-test.git'
```

Setup your remote by copying the instructions on the page for `an existing repository from the command line`:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:jeffrafter/honk-test.git
```

Then push:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

On GitHub, click on the `Actions` tab of your repository. Nothing is running yet. Remember, our workflow only runs when issue comments are created. [Open an issue](https://github.com/jeffrafter/honk-test/issues/1) and then create a comment that doesn't contain the word `honk`.

![Please honk](../../assets/please-honk.png)

Once you add the comment, the action will run and be marked as successful.

![Honk action run](../../assets/honk-action-run.png)

The action should have deleted the comment and added a honk comment in it's place:

# Using GitHub Actions to run your tests

Not only can we create GitHub actions, we can use them. We'll setup an action to run our tests whenever new code is pushed to GitHub. This form of CI (or Continuous Integration) is what GitHub Actions was built for.

Create a new file called `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    strategy:
      matrix:
        node-version: [12.x]

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Use Node.js ${{ matrix.node-version }}
        uses: actions/setup-node@v1
        with:
          node-version: ${{ matrix.node-version }}
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm test
```

Add this file:

```bash
git add .
```

And commit it:

```bash
git commit -m "Add CI"
```

And then push to GitHub:

```bash
git push origin master
```

You should see your tests run and build pass with a green checkmark.
