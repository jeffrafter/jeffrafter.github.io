Finding things on GitHub is often very difficult. Part of the problem is the scale of information (which should be solvable) and part of the problem is that there are several overlapping goals when searching (which should also be solvable).

Search by term
Search by phrase
Fuzzy search
Semantic search
Search by filename
Search by owner
Search by category
Taxonomies
Curation
Algorithmic
