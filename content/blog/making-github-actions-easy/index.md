Furby is probably the most advanced, well designed, impossibly elegant child's toy that exists and could be the key to unlocking the emotion of pair-programming. It might seem like the stuff of nightmares: these small talking robots dancing and singing and clamoring for your attention, but as a developer or user experience designer it is an almost perfect medium.

## The Original Furby

The Furby was originally released in \_\_\_\_. That Christmas, it was the toy to have and inspired the movie Jingle All the Way with Arnold Schwarzeneggar and Sinbad. Not many toys can claim that. The original Furby was a marvel.

## Furby Connect

Hasbro released the Furby Connect in 2012. In 2012, however, mad hordes of shoppers weren't tackling one another in shopping aisles to purchase the last one. If only the shoppers had understood the power. The Furby Connect is a dancing, singing robotic toy much like its predecessor.
