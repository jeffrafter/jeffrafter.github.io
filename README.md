ðŸ‘‹ Hi.

I'm Jeff. I'm a Senior Software Engineer @GitHub. where I get to invent and work and play all at the same time. I have a great family (Ali, Jude & Gavin) and a great dog (Stella). I studied Creative Writing and English Literature at the University of Iowa and once upon a time wrote some techinical books.

This repository is where I write long-form posts on how to do things on the Internet for [my blog](https://jeffrafter.com).

My website is hosted on GitHub Pages and is built using Gatsby. The theme is inspired by the work of Edward Tufte.

Feel free to check out the [comments](https://github.com/jeffrafter/jeffrafter.github.io/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22Comments+%3Aspeech_balloon%3A%22)
