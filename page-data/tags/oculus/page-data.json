Of course, the moment I put it on, I immediately wanted to make my own games and got started with Unity. There are a few blog posts and videos that helped me on my way.  Getting started To develop for you Oculus you’ll not only need an Oculus account but you may want to setup an Oculus Organiztion (free). Additionally (for my purposes), you’ll need a Unity account. I’m using a personal account (also free). Mac versus Windows I’m using a MacBook Pro. Many of the tutorials and videos you’ll find assume you’re working on Windows. This can create some challenges but the biggest challenges are around the platform support for the Oculus Quest itself. Oculus doesn’t make a version of it’s Oculus Desktop app (or libraries) available on MacOS. Because of this you’ll want to start with tutorials that are specific to the Mac and adjust. Unity & initial setup I followed a couple of tutorials for getting Unity Hub and Unity installed. I recommend: How to get started with Oculus Quest and Unity on macOS How to get started with Oculus Quest development in Unity If you prefer videos:  Learn Once I had the basics working, and could load games I built in Unity on my Quest, I wanted to do more. I found a set of fantastic tutorial videos by Valem, Quentin Valembois and was hooked. As I went through the videos I took notes and (with permission) am posting those here. While watching these videos, you might notice Valem is using the ▶ button to debug. This works because he is actually developing for the Rift in the videos (notice that the controllers are upside-down). In a later video on recreating Slenderman (at 1:47) he explains how to use the ▶ button while building for the Oculus Quest. Unfortunately that won’t work on MacOS because the Oculus plugin is not supported. There are notes on how to get this working at the end of this post.  A note on the Oculus Integration asset The Oculus Integration in the Unity Asset Store solves an amazing amount of problems for you. Unfortunately,\nthe updates are not necessarily backward compatible and it makes following tutorials difficult. Most\nof the tutorials listed here were for the 1.38 version. The current 1.39 version requires a few more steps. After you download and import the kit you’ll restart Unity. You should see a new menu for Oculus:  Choose  | . Choose  |  From your project search, find the newly created  and open it in your editor.\nYou’ll want to change  to  so that\nwhen you choose  it will actually run the generated APK on your Oculus Quest.

A really simple fix is to set the body and the hand to a different layer then in Physics settings uncheck the collision between the two layer in the collision layer matrix! :) Hope this will help some of you!” https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sKQOlqNe_WY&lc=Ugy0IV2wmiRMywTkPk94AaABAg Note: setting up layer interactions happens more in the next section.

You could remove this line, but it will only lead to another problem down the line. Instead fix the  by changing this line (for me it is line 40) of : to: Changing this eliminates the error, but the OVR Headset Emulator script will not work. The problem is that the  is never initialized and therefore the  is never initialized. The  method (at line 893 for me) looks like: The Unity Editor on Mac does not support the  (it is an unsupported platform). That’s fine, but let’s pretend it was initialized, even though it is unsupported (changing  to ): With this, the ▶ button should work for some quicker debugging. Note: nothing is running on the Oculus when you use that button, it is all faked. As of 1.39, when you are finished playing your scene the  block will be called for  (if you have a ).\nYou’ll see an error in the console (though it really doesn’t cause a problem). To fix it change: to:  Seeing what is happening on the Oculus Quest Building programs for the Rift was easier because you could debug everything that was happening in realtime. On the Quest you can’t but you can see what is happening on the device and view logs using , the Android Debug Bridge. On a Mac, in a Terminal, run: Once that is installed, attach your Oculus via USB-C and run: This should attach a view for a single eye. If you want to see both eyes you can just use  . If you get an error about the connection you can usually run: If that doesn’t work you can do the more extreme: And then run  again. You can also connect to the Quest and see the logs. For more information on using  with the Oculus Quest you can follow the tutorial. Checking the logs All of your  files are running on the quest and you can’t really investigate what is happening\nthrough Unity. However, you check the logs from the Quest. The logs are verbose so it is sometimes\nhelpful to start by clearing them: Then check them: You can append to the log using  statements in your application. Connecting via Wi-fi First you’ll want to make sure that the device is connected via USB: Once you’ve got the device connected you can check it’s local IP address: Now setup  for the connected device and tell it to listen on port : Once you’ve done this the device is still connected to USB and your computer is communicating via\nUSB but it is also listening for  connections via Wi-Fi. Connect to it via Wi-Fi: At this point you can unplug the USB cable and you should still be able to work with the Quest via\n over Wi-Fi. For example: If you want to explicitly connect to a particular Quest you can specify the server with : To go back to using USB, plug in the cable again and connect:  More learning I’ve used other resources when learning. I’ll list some of them here: The Ultimate Guide to Game Development with Unity 2019. This course costs between $10-12 if you catch it on sale. I highly recommend it if you are just getting started. It clearly explains how to move around the Unity interface, how to move quickly, and basic concepts of scripting. Using the new Terrain Tools: Speed up your work with the new Terrain Tools Package.
