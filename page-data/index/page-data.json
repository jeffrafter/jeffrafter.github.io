If you’re building a static website like a blog then deploying to GitHub Pages is more than enough. But what if the website you are building needs user authentication and authorization? What if you need to store and retrieve items from a database? What if you need server side processing. What if you want to integrate payment processing? There are a lot of options and managing it all quickly becomes difficult. Who is this for? This is a long post. Even by my standards. Also, this isn’t exactly introductory or beginner friendly (though I do try to explain how things are setup and how to make decisions). This post is more of a long-winded reference. I’ve written it because I needed opinionated documentation with all of my choices in one place. Your choices will probably be different because there are lots of trade-offs. Because this is opinionated it is also limited. There are many deeper technical topics I omit because I don’t use them. Nevertheless, hopefully this is useful for you. Some history Years ago, I was helping to build an E-Commerce startup. It was one of those experiences where you’re surrounded by brilliant and creative people that can make anything. Our platform was built using Ruby on Rails 1.2, relied on an early beta of Stripe for payment processing, and we used the beta of Slack to communicate. We deployed everything to Amazon Web Services because we knew it could scale. At the time the tooling was limited. So we hired a consultant named Mitchell Hashimoto to help us. Mitchell and I would work late setting up the infrastructure using a series of YAML files and a AWS API tool called fog. It was rudimentary but it worked amazingly well. From experience I can tell you that Mitchell is one of the fastest, most brilliant people I have ever seen. He built everything we needed flawlessly. One night, he started telling me about what he envisioned as a much better configuration language and platform. Looking back, I realize now he was envisioning Terraform. Setup Before you begin building anything it is useful to understand the trade-offs associated with different platforms, frameworks, and languages. When I’m building something new I tend to optimize for the following: Price Scalability Performance Maintainability It is very likely your priorities are different. I put price first because I don’t want to be restricted from making a lot of websites. Using Now or…","fields":{"slug":"/terraform-and-aws/"},"frontmatter":{"excerpt":"There are a lot of options for configuring AWS.

You can quickly prototype a game and show it off. But what if there are multiple developers. Storing your source code on GitHub makes collaboration easy; but there are a lot of tradeoffs when working with larger assets and projects. Unity has built-in collaboration functionality: https://unity.com/unity/features/collaborate Likewise, GitHub has released tools for working with GitHub inside Unity: https://unity.github.com/ In my case, I often use the command-line or GitHub Desktop. Create the project. Within the project we’ll need to setup git: There are a lot of files that we don’t want to track in version control. These files are specific to our machine and editor and can’t be easily shared. We want to ignore them, so create a file called : This  is based on the standard one found at https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Unity.gitignore.\nNote that we are ignoring:  files. These are specific to OSX. You may want to ignore other files specific to your code editor or operating system (for example if you use Vim). We’ve also ignored the  folder. This folder contains IL2CPP files that may or may not be generated depending on how you are building your project. As the name implied you want to keep a backup of this folder for every release of your game (it helps with debugging user submitting bug reports); but we don’t need it in version control. If you normally put your project files in a subfolder you may want to change how the folders are listed. For example: Here the leading  indicates that only folders matching the names in the root folder should be ignored. But in many cases you’ll want to ignore these files even if they are in a subfolder. To do this, remove the leading : Alternatively, you can leave the file as it is and move the  to the subfolder. We’ll have a lot of large files (audio, textures, models). When changing these files the entire file is changed (not a single line as in text files) Next we’ll need to setup Git LFS (large file storage). On GitHub you get a certain amount of LFS storage and bandwidth for free every month. The limits are per account (not per repository): Every account using Git Large File Storage receives 1 GB of free storage and 1 GB a month of free bandwidth. If the bandwidth and storage quotas are not enough, you can choose to purchase an additional quota for Git LFS.  Additional bandwidth or storage costs money (though it is fairly inexpensive). Because of this, the LFS…","fields":{"slug":"/unity-and-github/"},"frontmatter":{"excerpt":"Working with Unity makes development easy. You can quickly prototype a game and show it off.

Before I was a teenager my grandfather bought me the now classic Getting Started In Electronics which has been called The Greatest Electronics Book Ever Written. I struggled to understand it and never had the parts to try out the circuits; working instead with pencil and paper and ending up confused. These days it is pretty easy to get lots of parts cheaply to try things out.  Buy some parts To get started it is good to have some electronics to play with. We’ll need: Any Arduino (preferably an ESP8266 based device) Breadboard LED A  resistor Some jumper wires Micro-USB cable These parts are often hard to find individually so I tend to buy them in kits. I purchased the following: ESP8266 NodeMCU: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081CSJV2V ($13.99 pack of 3) Smraza Basic Starter Kit: https://www.amazon.com/Arduino-Starter-Tutorials-Compatible-Mega2560/dp/B01MATM4XF ($19.98) Micro-USB cables: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V6GZ5GM ($7.99 pack of 5) Wall chargers (2.1A 5V): https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B082TZZJZR ($9.99 pack of 3) You don’t need to buy multiples (often I buy three of each thing), but I’ve found I want to have multiple projects going at once. You might have micro-USB and wall chargers laying around which should be fine: just make sure they are 5V, ~2A  and that the cables are data cables. The Smraza Basic Starter Kit has a ton of parts - most of which we aren’t going to use here; but the kit is great and allows you to build all kinds of projects in the future.  Setup a circuit \n(designed on https://tinkercad.com) About breadboards Setting up a breadboard like this makes it easy to test simple circuits without needing to solder anything. You can connect different components using jumper wires (normal wires, that you push into the various holes on the breadboard). The breadboard makes it easy to do this because certain holes of the breadboard are connected internally. It is tough to guess how everything is connected if you are looking at a breadboard for the first time.  The breadboard has two halves, each with two “power rails” (red and black in the above diagram). Each row is connected: for example row : , , ,  and  are all connected internally (shown in green above). The gap running down the center of the breadboard separates the two sides.  The , , , ,  slots are all connected and…","fields":{"slug":"/getting-started-with-arduino-and-esp8266/"},"frontmatter":{"excerpt":"Understanding the basics of hardware can open new projects and new possibilities and it is more accessible and inexpensive than ever.","date":"May 20, 2020","title":"Getting started with ESP8266 and Arduino"}}},{"node":{"excerpt":"Previously, I posted about Working with GitHub Actions. It covered the basics of setting up a repository, configuring embedded actions and the associated workflows. If you haven’t worked with GitHub Actions before, you might want to read that first. Once you’ve created your amazing GitHub Actions, you’ll want to re-use them and share them with your friends. To do that you’ll want to organize your project a little differently. Also, you’ll want to release your actions with all of the dependencies included so that they run efficiently. In this post we’ll create a repository which contains a GitHub Action - built in TypeScript - and a second repository which will use the action. Before you read this it is important to note: starting with a template will save you a lot of time and setup. Creating actions can be very simple. In this post, however, I am going to work through and explain all of the steps. Included in this post are some of the reasons I’ve chosen one particular setup and skipped another. When getting started with GitHub Actions it is difficult to understand how all of the pieces fit together, or why you might want to create an action for a particular task. Hopefully this post provides some helpful examples. That said, there are probably steps here that you’ve seen before, don’t care about, or just want to skip and that’s okay. In order to follow this, you’ll need a GitHub account. You’ll need Node, Node Version Manager (), and Node Package Manager (). The examples will be in TypeScript. All of the code is available at https://github.com/jeffrafter/honk-action. Honk For our example we’ll create a GitHub Action which listens for new issue comments - if the comment doesn’t contain the word “honk” our action will delete the comment and add a new comment with a picture of the goose from Untitled Goose Game. This isn’t very practical, but it should serve as a good foundation for building actions that respond to comments. Here is the layout for our action: Notice that  and  are both in the root of our repository. In this case our action is not very complex, using only a single file. If you have a complex action which contains many modules it might make sense to to put these into a  or  folder. We’ll dig into each of these files.

Of course, the moment I put it on, I immediately wanted to make my own games and got started with Unity. There are a few blog posts and videos that helped me on my way.  Getting started To develop for you Oculus you’ll not only need an Oculus account but you may want to setup an Oculus Organiztion (free). Additionally (for my purposes), you’ll need a Unity account. I’m using a personal account (also free). Mac versus Windows I’m using a MacBook Pro. Many of the tutorials and videos you’ll find assume you’re working on Windows. This can create some challenges but the biggest challenges are around the platform support for the Oculus Quest itself. Oculus doesn’t make a version of it’s Oculus Desktop app (or libraries) available on MacOS. Because of this you’ll want to start with tutorials that are specific to the Mac and adjust. Unity & initial setup I followed a couple of tutorials for getting Unity Hub and Unity installed. I recommend: How to get started with Oculus Quest and Unity on macOS How to get started with Oculus Quest development in Unity If you prefer videos:  Learn Once I had the basics working, and could load games I built in Unity on my Quest, I wanted to do more. I found a set of fantastic tutorial videos by Valem, Quentin Valembois and was hooked. As I went through the videos I took notes and (with permission) am posting those here. While watching these videos, you might notice Valem is using the ▶ button to debug. This works because he is actually developing for the Rift in the videos (notice that the controllers are upside-down). In a later video on recreating Slenderman (at 1:47) he explains how to use the ▶ button while building for the Oculus Quest. Unfortunately that won’t work on MacOS because the Oculus plugin is not supported. There are notes on how to get this working at the end of this post.  A note on the Oculus Integration asset The Oculus Integration in the Unity Asset Store solves an amazing amount of problems for you. Unfortunately,\nthe updates are not necessarily backward compatible and it makes following tutorials difficult. Most\nof the tutorials listed here were for the 1.38 version. The current 1.39 version requires a few more steps. After you download and import the kit you’ll restart Unity. You should see a new menu for Oculus:  Choose  | .
