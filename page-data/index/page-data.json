But if you are looking to get started the possibilities are endless. This guide is mostly about pointing to documentation and exploring some fun ways to use GitHub Actions. In this post we’ll create a repository which contains a GitHub Action - built in TypeScript - and an associated workflow. In the action we’ll respond to push events and output some logging information. Technically, you don’t need a custom script to accomplish this; you could instead build a very simple workflow which runs  commands. Using a full script will allow us to explore more capabilities of GitHub Actions. We’ll also create an action that automatically responds to, and reacts to, issue comments. Before you read this it is important to note: starting with a template will save you a lot of time and setup. In this post, however, I am going to work through and explain all of the steps. Included in this post are some of the reasons I’ve chosen one particular setup and skipped another. When getting started with GitHub Actions it is difficult to understand how all of the pieces fit together, or why you might want to create and action for a particular task. Hopefully this post provides some helpful examples. That said, there are probably steps here that you’ve seen before, don’t care about, or just want to skip and that’s okay. In order to follow this, you’ll need a GitHub account. Additionally, you’ll need to sign up for the GitHub Actions beta. The examples will be in TypeScript. All of the code (and commits) are availble on GitHub: https://github.com/jeffrafter/example-github-action-typescript Documentation The documentation for GitHub Actions is really good (far more complete than this post) and is good to have on hand. You can learn how to build Actions, Workflows and core concepts; as well as dive deeply on using the toolkit, octokit and handling payloads. Automating your Workflow with GitHub Actions GitHub Package Toolkit Event Types & Payloads Rest API V3 octokit/rest.js Getting started First you want to create a folder for your project: We’ll be using TypeScript to build our action, which requires Node. Out of the box GitHub supports a few environments for your actions to run . There is built-in support for running actions built in JavaScript (using Node). So why did I choose to use TypeScript?

Of course, the moment I put it on, I immediately wanted to make my own games and got started with Unity. There are a few blog posts and videos that helped me on my way.  Getting started To develop for you Oculus you’ll not only need an Oculus account but you may want to setup an Oculus Organiztion (free). Additionally (for my purposes), you’ll need a Unity account. I’m using a personal account (also free). Mac versus Windows I’m using a MacBook Pro. Many of the tutorials and videos you’ll find assume you’re working on Windows. This can create some challenges but the biggest challenges are around the platform support for the Oculus Quest itself. Oculus doesn’t make a version of it’s Oculus Desktop app (or libraries) available on MacOS. Because of this you’ll want to start with tutorials that are specific to the Mac and adjust. Unity & initial setup I followed a couple of tutorials for getting Unity Hub and Unity installed. I recommend: How to get started with Oculus Quest and Unity on macOS How to get started with Oculus Quest development in Unity If you prefer videos:  Learn Once I had the basics working, and could load games I built in Unity on my Quest, I wanted to do more. I found a set of fantastic tutorial videos by Valem, Quentin Valembois and was hooked. As I went through the videos I took notes and (with permission) am posting those here. While watching these videos, you might notice Valem is using the ▶ button to debug. This works because he is actually developing for the Rift in the videos (notice that the controllers are upside-down). In a later video on recreating Slenderman (at 1:47) he explains how to use the ▶ button while building for the Oculus Quest. Unfortunately that won’t work on MacOS because the Oculus plugin is not supported. There are notes on how to get this working at the end of this post.  A note on the Oculus Integration asset The Oculus Integration in the Unity Asset Store solves an amazing amount of problems for you. Unfortunately,\nthe updates are not necessarily backward compatible and it makes following tutorials difficult. Most\nof the tutorials listed here were for the 1.38 version. The current 1.39 version requires a few more steps. After you download and import the kit you’ll restart Unity. You should see a new menu for Oculus:  Choose  | . Choose  |  From your project search, find the newly created  and open it in your editor.\nYou’ll want to change  to  so…","fields":{"slug":"/oculus-quest/"},"frontmatter":{"date":"July 25, 2019","title":"Developing for the Oculus Quest","excerpt":"Everyone wants to talk about consumer VR.

If you have multiple local projects you might run into a conflict about which Node version should be used. Node Version Manager solves this problem. To control which version of Node should be used in your project, add an  file: The file is pretty simple; just the version. At the time you read this there may be a newer version of Node. You can check https://nodejs.org.  Ignore some things We plan to use  to keep track of our changes. As we work on our project locally, there will be a lot of files we won’t want to keep track of; we’ll want to ignore them. To do this we’ll create a new file called  . These files can be very short and specific, or they can be very long and general. We’ll use a more generic one that will work on different kinds of computers.
